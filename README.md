# MACTA.R

R package for running multiple automated cell type annotation packages

## Implemented tools:
- SingleR
- SCINA
- Garnett
- UCell
- scPred
- scCATCH
- scMAP
- scMRMA
- scSorter
- Symphony
- scMAGIC

## Current task list:

1. Implement validators
2. Re-factor code into a more standardized and extensible format
3. Standardize environment for all R packages present
4. Share small testing environment with objects. Look into how this can be put into a larger framework rather than rudimentary R scripts.
